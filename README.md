📝 Project Description
Chicken Translator is a fun and quirky web app that pretends to decode chicken clucks into surprisingly deep (and completely fake) messages. Upload any "cluck" and receive hilarious poultry wisdom in return.

🐔 The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Chickens are constantly clucking, but no one understands what they’re trying to say. This unspoken poultry philosophy is a tragedy of modern society.

😅 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an app that uses a random quote generator (inspired by GPT-like absurdity) to turn any chicken sound into a profound, fake translation. Finally, chickens have a voice!
